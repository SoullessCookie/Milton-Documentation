### About Milton

Milton is a Discord bot (obviously). The original Milton project was started around: September 27th, 2020. For a long time, Milton was just a bunch of copy and pasted crap because I (SoullessCookie) had no clue how to code. I was following discord bot tutorials and stealing all of my code. I reached a point where I was just unable to fix my problems when developing. So... I started making minecraft mods. This allowed me to grasp the basics of coding and simple functions. Ever since then, I've been doing small JavaScript and C++ projects, leading me here. I thought it might be time to bring Milton back after all this time. So, on March 9th, 2023, Milton was re-imagined.

The Milton project is now being up-kept by 2 dedicated devs:

* **SoullessCookie**: _aka WrigglySplash_- Does most of the development including code, organization, project management, new feature implementation, and updates.

***

* **RoseyNose**- Does most of the back-end networking, database management, and making sure the bot doesn't die just because.

In terms of development, Milton is being worked on and updated Monday - Friday. Updates will be pushed to the public bot once the features are well-polished and deemed ready for use. We strive to keep a 99% uptime. Unfortunately, we cannot control any issues that happen with our hosting provider. If you want updates every time an Update is released or the bot goes down, join the community server: [https://discord.gg/ewHyNxR3MP](https://discord.gg/ewHyNxR3MP)

Obviously, Milton is a massive project that we plan on adding 50+ commands to. Sadly, we are both busy with college and jobs. Coding is a passion for both of use, but this type of project takes time. We've never done this before, so we are learning as we go. We would like to thank you for being there to support Milton in his early days and we hope he continues being your #1 discord bot.
